Hello! My name is Runkang Yang, and I am currently a sophomore at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My journey in the field of computer science has been driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for understanding the intricate mechanisms that power modern technology. My primary research interest lies in deep learning and its wide-ranging applications.

For more information please see myÂ [CV](https://rankyer.github.io//cv/).

* **[Jul. 2024]** Participated in the [Summer Workshop](https://sws.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at the School of Computing [(SOC)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), National University of Singapore [(NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/). (Subtopic: [Deep learning](https://sws.comp.nus.edu.sg/Deep-Learning.html))

## Academic Background

As a student at ShanghaiTech University, I have had the privilege of engaging with a diverse array of courses and projects that have solidified my foundation in computer science. My coursework has spanned topics such as computer programming, algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, software engineering, database system and so on, providing me with a broad and comprehensive understanding of the field.

Student Work Experience
-----------------------

* **Student assistant experience**
  * **[Sep. 2022 - present]** Since September 2022, I have been a student assistant at the Integrated Office of the **News Center** at ShanghaiTech University. I primarily work on editing and managing content for the university's official WeChat account, promoting online campus communication. This experience has honed my communication and organizational skills and allowed me to contribute to the vibrant campus life at ShanghaiTech.
* **Volunteer experience**
  * **[Sep. 2023]** Volunteer at the ASSIST 2023 (The 2023 Annual ShanghaiTech Symposium on Information Science and Technology).
  * **[Aug. 2022]** Volunteer at the 9th iGEM Conference of China iGEMer Community.

Create content & metadata
-------------------------

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you&#39;ve given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
-----------------------------------------

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
