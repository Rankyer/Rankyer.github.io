Hello! My name is Runkang Yang from [Jiaozuo](https://zh-two.iwiki.icu/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&search=%E7%84%A6%E4%BD%9C%E5%B8%82), Henan in China 🐾, and I am currently a senior at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science and Technology🖥️.

During my undergraduate studies, I had the honor of being a research intern at the [LINs Lab](https://lins-lab.github.io/), where I focused on data-efficient AI 🚀 and generative AI 🎨 under the guidance of Prof. [Tao Lin](https://tlin-taolin.github.io/) at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/). Additionally, I was privileged to work as a research intern at [TeleAI](https://www.teleai.com.cn/), focusing on visual understanding for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) 🤖, supervised by Prof. [Dell Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M0Ltb88AAAAJ&hl=en).

I am also a candidate for the joint Ph.D. program between [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm) and [BYD](https://www.bydglobal.com/cn/index.html). Currently, I am a research intern at the [FD-LAMT Lab](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/weilics/zh_CN/zdylm/644067/list/index.htm), supervised by Prof. [Wei Li](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/weilics/zh_CN/index/119021/list/index.htm) at Fudan University. My research focuses on Computer Audition 🔊 and Music AI 🎶.

<!-- My research interest lies in **Efficient AI** *(dataset/knowledge distillation)* 🚀 & **Generative AI** *(diffusion models)* 🎨. -->
